			<p>37For as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.38For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark,39and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away, so too will be the coming of the Son of Man.40 Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.41Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will be left.42Keep awake therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.43But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into.44Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.</p>
