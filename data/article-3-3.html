			<p><sup>7</sup>Be patient, therefore, beloved, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits for the precious crop from the earth, being patient with it until it receives the early and the late rains.<sup>8</sup>You also must be patient. Strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.<sup>9</sup>Beloved, do not grumble against one another, so that you may not be judged. See, the Judge is standing at the doors!<sup>10</sup>As an example of suffering and patience, beloved, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</p>
