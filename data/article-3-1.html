			<p>We are well into the season of Advent - a time of preparation and waiting. In the world around us, we have the distractions of shopping, parties, end of year school events, and the need for a good rest. </p>
			<p>Advent is indeed a time of waiting. Waiting involves patience. </p>
			<p>Today's second reading is all about patience. We hear of how the farmer waits for the rain for the crops. Many Australian farmers can relate to this. We are a country of drought, especially in these Summer times. We wait for rain and when it does arrive, its benefits are widespread. We can see the links of Advent as we wait for Jesus. And what of the benefits when he arrives?</p>
			<p>When reading the Gospel from Matthew, we are not waiting for the birth of Jesus; he is already here. John's followers go out looking for Jesus, asking Jesus if he is the Messiah. Jesus tells them to look around them, as proof that he is already with them, and to see what he has been doing.</p>
			<p>One message we may take from this reading is that we should be able to see God in the world around us; even though Jesus is God- made- man; God was already with us. </p>
			<p>Where do you see God? In creation? In those people around you?  In the scriptures? </p>
            <p>For some, Jesus is more tangible, and we are disciples of Jesus. As with other relationships, it is up to us to continue to grow our relationship with Jesus - isn't Advent a good time to do this?</p>
