			<p><sup>2</sup>When John heard in prison what the Messiah was doing, he sent word by his disciples<sup>3</sup>and said to him, "Are you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?"<sup>4</sup>Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you hear and see:<sup>5</sup>the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news brought to them.<sup>6</sup>And blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me."</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?<sup>8</sup>What then did you go out to see? Someone dressed in soft robes? Look, those who wear soft robes are in royal palaces.<sup>9</sup>What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.<sup>10</sup>This is the one about whom it is written, 'See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.'<sup>11</sup>Truly I tell you, among those born of women no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</p>
