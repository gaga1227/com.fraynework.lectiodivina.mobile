			<p><sup>4</sup>For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, so that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope.</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>May the God of steadfastness and encouragement grant you to live in harmony with one another, in accordance with Christ Jesus,<sup>6</sup>so that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>Welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.<sup>8</sup>For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of the truth of God in order that he might confirm the promises given to the patriarchs,<sup>9</sup>and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, "Therefore I will confess you among the Gentiles, and sing praises to your name".</p>
