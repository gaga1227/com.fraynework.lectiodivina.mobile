				<p><b>Advent and Christmas is to be renewed in the reality and implications of the Incarnation.</b></p>
				<p>Do you believe in Santa Claus? At any time in your life have you ascribed to the delightful myth of the red-suited, portly, jolly and bearded, giver of gifts? A figure whose origins are usually associated with the equally mythical St. Nicholas, whose feast day was dropped from the calendar of our Church in 1969 when it was realized that no historical evidence of his existence could be produced, Santa Claus is nevertheless a popular Christmas character among young people in many western cultures. Variously called Papa NoÃ«l (France), Sinter Claes (Netherlands), Kriss Kringle (from the German Christ-kindl), etc., the very idea of Santa Claus evokes excitement and eager anticipation in the hearts of those who prepare for his annual coming. Traditional songs, poems and stories remember and celebrate his appearance. Each year the letters sent to St. Nicholas or Santa Claus, with their lists of desired games, iPads and goodies, offer clear evidence of the firm faith and unflinching confidence of their young authors. No request is considered too great and each is made without a shadow of a doubt that Santa Claus and his elves will come through on Christmas morning.</p>
				<p>Inevitably, there comes a time in each child's life, when the wonder of Santa Claus is demythologized; along with the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy, the happy myth of Santa Claus must yield to the realization that others (parents, guardians, relatives) have been responsible for the joy and plenty of the Christmas season. Included in the process of demythologizing Santa is a necessary appreciation of the true spirituality of Christmas and of the liturgical season of Advent. For many, however, even their ideas about Christmas and Advent require some measure of demythologization.</p>
				<p>Perhaps it is the traditional trappings of the season or the simplistic notion that Christmas is merely the birthday of Jesus. . . whatever the reason, many of us become preoccupied with the star, the shepherds and the stable as the representations of a long-ago birth. Retelling the story certainly has its merits provided that all the ramifications and dimensions of that event are also appreciated. Each Advent, we celebrate the coming, not only of a baby Jesus born in Bethlehem, but of the risen and universal Christ. Each Advent season, we are plunged into his coming, past, present and future; in a wondrous intermingling of possession and expectation, we celebrate the abiding and saving presence of Jesus. As Karl Rahner once explained, the liturgy of the Advent season "unites the past, that is, the Old Testament longing for the coming of salvation, that was still hidden in God alone; the present, that is, the salvation that is now taking place in the world but which is still hidden in Christ; and the future, that is, the salvation which will be unveiled with the transformation of the world at the end of time." The Church which yearly observes the season of Advent "must make memorial of and re-experience all three mysterious stages of salvation." (The Great Church Year, Crossroads Pub. Co., New York: 1994).</p>
				<p>To demythologize Advent and Christmas is to be renewed in the reality and implications of the Incarnation. Because Christ has come once, he will come again; indeed he has never left, but is continually present in his Church. For this reason, Advent is at once a celebration of the Christ who was, who is and always will be. In addition to being a season of the year, Advent is also a mystery; that is to say, it is a present reality that contains and mediates salvation. In his book, The Revolutionary year, Jay C. Rochelle underscores the importance of celebrating the liturgical mysteries. Celebrations are "a way of organizing religious experience throughout the seasons of the revolutionary year and a medium through which God's love may be experienced in and through others." Rochelle uses the term "revolutionary year," explaining that from both an emotional and intellectual perspective, the Church assists us to undergo a personal and communal revolution each year we celebrate it" (The Revolutionary Year, Fortress Press, Philadelphia: 1973).</p>
				<p>Do you believe in Santa Claus? More importantly, do you believe in Jesus? Over the coming four weeks of Advent, culminating in the Feast of Christmas, the scriptural texts will confront us with the abiding presence of Jesus in the world, in the Church, in the Word, and in the Bread of Life. How shall his ever-coming and continual saving presence revolutionize your life this year? </p>
