			<p>Waiting, an inevitable and even necessary aspect of human life is not something that most of us relish. We wait in lines: in order to purchase groceries; to be served at popular restaurants; to be attended to in a bank; at stop signs and traffic signals; at amusement parts; to see a play or film. We must also wait for flowers to grow and bloom; for babies to be born; for wounds to heal; for bread to rise and cheese to age; for children to mature; for friends to call; for love to deepen. Statisticians have estimated that in a lifetime of 70 years, the average person spends at least three years waiting! </p>
			<p>For believers, however, it is not inconceivable to think of the entire span of a human life as a period of waiting --waiting for the God who comes.</p>
			<p>Samuel Beckett, Irish author, critic and playwright, and winner of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1969, cast a rather pessimistic eye on this aspect of the human condition. Along with Albert Camus, Eug√®ne Ionesco and Arthur Adamov, Beckett regarded the very notion of waiting for fulfilment or divine intervention as absurd. In his play, Waiting for Godot (1953), two people, Vladimir and Estragon (who are often portrayed as tramps) spend their lives patiently, but aimlessly, waiting for someone who never comes. To exacerbate the situation, the two characters have no evidence that Godot (probably God) intends to come or that he even exists. Set on a stage, empty except for a solitary tree, the two figures enunciate Beckett's perception of human existence as mindless and purposeless. At this point, Beckett introduces a second pair of characters who unlike Vladimir and Estragon, pursue and attain their well-defined objectives, e.g. power, wealth, a desirable spouse, yet their lives also are empty and without meaning.</p>
			<p>Happily, the Theatre of the Absurd with its hopelessness and pessimism has no place in the life of the believer, except perhaps to renew in him/her a gratitude for the gift of a God who comes, who has come, who will come and who never departs. Because of this, Advent is a season characterized, not by mindlessness and purposelessness but by a delicious joy and eager anticipation.</p>
			<p>In the first reading from Isaiah, the prophet gives voice to the eager hopes of his people who confidently awaited the messiah and all that his reign would bring. In the gospel, John the Baptizer proclaims that the waiting and messianic longings of his people are to be answered in the person and mission of Jesus. But preparations must be made; through repentance and faith, believers are to prepare a welcome for him in their lives. Paul, in writing to the Romans reminds his readers that those who wait together for the many comings of our God should overlook their differences and sustain one another in mutual support and acceptance.</p>
			<p>While we may never learn to enjoy the pragmatic waiting which is a part of our everyday activities, we are reminded, in today's liturgy, to savour the joyful waiting which is Advent. He comes; he shall not disappoint. Repentance, faith, and communal harmony are all the welcome he desires.</p>
