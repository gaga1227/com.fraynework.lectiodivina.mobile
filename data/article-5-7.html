			<p><b>3</b> This is the reason that I Paul am a prisoner for Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles-<sup>2</sup>for surely you have already heard of the commission of God's grace that was given me for you,<sup>3</sup>and how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I wrote above in a few words,<sup>4</sup>a reading of which will enable you to perceive my understanding of the mystery of Christ.<sup>5</sup>In former generations this mystery was not made known to humankind, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit:<sup>6</sup>that is, the Gentiles have become fellow heirs, members of the same body, and sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.<sup>7</sup>Of this gospel I have become a servant according to the gift of God's grace that was given me by the working of his power.<sup>8</sup>Although I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given to me to bring to the Gentiles the news of the boundless riches of Christ,<sup>9</sup>and to make everyone see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things;<sup>10</sup>so that through the church the wisdom of God in its rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.<sup>11</sup>This was in accordance with the eternal purpose that he has carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,<sup>12</sup>in whom we have access to God in boldness and confidence through faith in him.</p>
