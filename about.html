				<h2>Overview of Lectio Divina</h2>

					<i>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God…and the Word was made flesh.</i>

				</p>
				<p> The Word of God is Jesus. He is the human face of God. It is Jesus who gives meaning to the whole of God's revelation, and brings to a climax the continuing testimonies of God's love for us. Any understanding of the expression "Word of God" must be interpreted in the light of Jesus, the Word. The expression "the Word" came to signify the message that Jesus preached, his whole approach to humankind (Lk 8:12), and also the fledgling Christian movement as it began to spread under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. (Acts 12:24, 6:7)</p>
				<p>The Church also acknowledges as the "Word of God" the inspired writings recognised by the early Christian community. These inspired writings are God's gift to the Church, and in them God's overwhelming love shines through. They embody in human word what is embodied in the divine Word who became flesh; and through this inspired human word of the Scriptures we encounter personally the divine Word himself.</p>
				<p> Since the beginning of the Christian movement, its members have read the Scriptures as God's Word speaking to them. They found in them who their God is, the loving providence of their God, their own identity as God's people, and the responsibilities that go with God's choice of them to share the divine love with others. As Mary reflected on the unfolding mystery of her divine Son, Christians have continued to reflect on that same mystery which comes to us in the Scriptures. (Luke 2:51).</p>
				<p>The reflective reading of the Scriptures leads us to know, understand and appropriate the fundamental Christian mysteries. It helps us to appreciate what we need to do to respond to God's approach in them, and holds up to us a mirror of how we are responding and what we might need to do to improve and deepen our response. It humbles us and makes us realise that we need God to walk with us on this journey: we cannot walk it alone. It brings us to prayer, in which we implore the divine help. It leads, too, to the transformation of our life of response to God, and enables us, through our lives as disciples of Jesus, to share the divine love we have known with those around us.</p>
				<p>This meditative, prayerful reading of the Scriptures has been referred to as lectio divina. It can take many forms, but it is necessary to keep in mind the essential aspects of it, lest we read into the Scriptures what we want to hear rather than hear from them what God wants to tells us. St Augustine's words are relevant: the one who serves you best is not the one who listens for what he wants to hear, but the one who shapes his life according to what he hears. To help us focus on the essential, this App will adopt the practice as described by Guigo ll, the fifth abbot of the Carthusan order, in his book "The Ladder of Monks (A Letter on the Contemplative Life) and Twelve Meditations."</p>
				<p>Lectio divina then, is the meditative reading of a text of God's Word, the Scriptures, alone or with others, which leads to prayer, transformation of life, and, through that transformed life, the sharing with others of the mystery of God entrusted to us. This practice of prayer involves the whole person. Through our senses we read, we meditate using our reason and imagination, and we pray and transform our life with our will. It is not just an interior practice but one that engages with the issues of our Christian life and prompts us to work with them. At different times, the emphasis may be on different aspects of the prayer. But it would be unwise to omit any of them altogether.</p>
				<p>In the light of what has been said, we can look at the presuppositions that underpin this form of Scriptural prayer. Firstly it embraces the Scriptures as God's Word speaking to us. It emphasises that this practice is a personal encounter with the eternal Word, who is Jesus. It sees, as the source and goal of this prayer, the life of Christian discipleship.</p>
				<p>The image of the arch is sometimes used to speak of prayer. Prayer is designated as the keystone of the arch, the stone at the top which takes the strain, and stops the sides of the arch from falling in. However, the keystone will not stay up there by itself: it needs the sides of the arch. The sides of the arch are working with our life; to root out the vices and to practice the virtues. The practice of lectio is not a discrete or isolated event, totally sufficient in itself: it takes place within the living of Christian discipleship. It arises out of the conscious determined effort to live as disciples of Jesus and has as its goal to strengthen that determination and effort. Transformation of life is an essential element of praying the Scriptures.</p>
				<p>How we read the Scriptures will depend on how we understand them. If we recognise them as coming from the God who loves us, we could liken reading them to the beloved reading the letters from her lover. It is the one who loves God deeply who is the most likely to appreciate the deepest dimension of the Scriptures. The Scriptures are not just a book, but a library, with many authors. Any one author may not have known the writings of any other. However, there is a unity here. This is the story of God's love for us, and this is so because the unifying author of all of the Scriptures is the Spirit of God.</p>
				<p>This means that in reading the Scriptures we do need to appreciate that there are two senses: that of the historical author and that of the Spirit. The historical critical method helps us to appreciate the historical meaning, but we need another methodology to appreciate the "Spiritual" sense: the message that transcends the historical sense, and gives the Scriptures their unique character. Unless we recognise this divine spiritual sense, the Scriptures can be seen as a book of the past, just an historical work, to be explained simply in human terms. Lectio divina is always a theological reading of the text of Scripture.</p>
				<p>The Scriptures, through the Spirit, emerged from the early Christian community. It was the Church that brought together these disparate books into one canon to make the Scriptures. The life of the early Church was the matrix into which the Scriptures were born. The Scriptures need to be understood and interpreted within the life of the Church. The covenant that God offers in the Scriptures is not with the individual, but with the people. The Church is the community of believers, the community of those who respond to the love of God. It is those that have faith, and are living a loving response to God's love, who can be most open to the divine message of the Scriptures. Just as the Church was the matrix in which the Scriptures were born, so it needs to be the matrix within which we interpret them. The Scriptures need to be read within the faith community.</p>
				<p>Lectio divina arises out of a faith relationship with Jesus and reaches its fulfilment in the transformation of that faith relationship. The Scriptures are more open to those active disciples who love God and who are endeavouring to transform their life in conformity with their faith. It is the heart filled with this loving faith that will be most open to the spiritual message of the Scriptures. Active effort to live a life of Christian virtue is an important preparation for reading the Scriptures.</p>

				<h2>Overview of the Season</h2>
				<p><b>Advent and Christmas is to be renewed in the reality and implications of the Incarnation.</b></p>
				<p>Do you believe in Santa Claus? At any time in your life have you ascribed to the delightful myth of the red-suited, portly, jolly and bearded, giver of gifts? A figure whose origins are usually associated with the equally mythical St. Nicholas, whose feast day was dropped from the calendar of our Church in 1969 when it was realised that no historical evidence of his existence could be produced, Santa Claus is nevertheless a popular Christmas character among young people in many western cultures. Variously called Papa Noël (France), Sinter Claes (Netherlands), Kriss Kringle (from the German <i>Christ-kindl</i>), etc., the very idea of Santa Claus evokes excitement and eager anticipation in the hearts of those who prepare for his annual coming. Traditional songs, poems and stories remember and celebrate his appearance. Each year the letters sent to St. Nicholas or Santa Claus, with their lists of desired games, iPads and goodies, offer clear evidence of the firm faith and unflinching confidence of their young authors. No request is considered too great and each is made without a shadow of a doubt that Santa Claus and his elves will come through on Christmas morning.</p>
				<p>Inevitably, there comes a time in each child's life, when the wonder of Santa Claus is demythologised; along with the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy, the happy myth of Santa Claus must yield to the realisation that others (parents, guardians, relatives) have been responsible for the joy and plenty of the Christmas season. Included in the process of demythologising Santa is a necessary appreciation of the <i>true</i> spirituality of Christmas and of the liturgical season of Advent. For many, however, even their ideas about Christmas and Advent require some measure of demythologisation.</p>
				<p>Perhaps it is the traditional trappings of the season or the simplistic notion that Christmas is merely the birthday of Jesus. . . whatever the reason, many of us become preoccupied with the star, the shepherds and the stable as the representations of a long-ago birth. Retelling the story certainly has its merits provided that <i>all</i> the ramifications and dimensions of that event are also appreciated. Each Advent, we celebrate the coming, not only of a baby Jesus born in Bethlehem, but of the risen and universal Christ. Each Advent season, we are plunged into his coming, past, present and future; in a wondrous intermingling of possession and expectation, we celebrate the <i>abiding</i> and <i>saving</i> presence of Jesus. As Karl Rahner once explained, the liturgy of the Advent season "unites the past, that is, the Old Testament longing for the coming of salvation, that was still hidden in God alone; the present, that is, the salvation that is now taking place in the world but which is still hidden in Christ; and the future, that is, the salvation which will be unveiled with the transformation of the world at the end of time." The Church which yearly observes the season of Advent "must make memorial of and re-experience all three mysterious stages of salvation." (<i>The Great Church Year</i>, Crossroads Pub. Co., New York: 1994).</p>
				<p>To demythologise Advent and Christmas is to be renewed in the reality and implications of the Incarnation. Because Christ has come once, he will come again; indeed he has never left, but is continually present in his Church. For this reason, Advent is at once a celebration of the Christ who was, who is and always will be. In addition to being a season of the year, Advent is also a mystery; that is to say, it is a present reality that contains and mediates salvation. In his book, <i>The Revolutionary Year</i>, Jay C. Rochelle underscores the importance of <i>celebrating</i> the liturgical mysteries. Celebrations are "a way of organising religious experience throughout the seasons of the revolutionary year and a medium through which God's love may be experienced in and through others." Rochelle uses the term "revolutionary year," explaining that from both an emotional and intellectual perspective, the Church assists us to undergo a personal and communal revolution each year we celebrate it" (<i>The Revolutionary Year</i>, Fortress Press, Philadelphia: 1973).</p>
				<p>Do you believe in Santa Claus? More importantly, do you believe in Jesus? Over the coming four weeks of Advent, culminating in the Feast of Christmas, the scriptural texts will confront us with the abiding presence of Jesus in the <i>world</i>, in the <i>Church</i>, in the <i>Word</i>, and in the <i>Bread of Life</i>. How shall his ever-coming and continual saving presence revolutionise your life this year? </p>
