			<p><b>3</b> In those days John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness of Judea, proclaiming,<sup>2</sup>"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near."<sup>3</sup>This is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said, "The voice of one crying out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'"<sup>4</sup>Now John wore clothing of camel's hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.<sup>5</sup>Then the people of Jerusalem and all Judea were going out to him, and all the region along the Jordan,<sup>6</sup>and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
			<p><sup>7</sup>But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?<sup>8</sup>Bear fruit worthy of repentance.<sup>9</sup>Do not presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our ancestor'; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.<sup>10</sup>Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.<sup>11</sup>"I baptize you with water for repentance, but one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.<sup>12</sup>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire."</p>
