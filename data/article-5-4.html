			<p><b>2</b> In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered.<sup>2</sup>This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.<sup>3</sup>All went to their own towns to be registered.<sup>4</sup>Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the house and family of David.<sup>5</sup>He went to be registered with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child.<sup>6</sup>While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child.<sup>7</sup>And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</p>
			<p><sup>8</sup>In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night.<sup>9</sup>Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.<sup>10</sup>But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid; for see-I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people:<sup>11</sup>to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is the Messiah, the Lord.<sup>12</sup>This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger."<sup>13</sup>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,<sup>14</sup>"Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favours!" </p>
