			<p><sup>1</sup>Today's  second and third readings want to place us on red alert! Paul says it's time to  wake up from sleep. The Gospel warns us to stay awake and not be caught  unaware. The images of what happens t those who are unprepared sound  frightening: a thief in the night breaks in; one man in a field is taken and  the other one left; one woman grinding at the mill is taken and the other one  left. We are warned, &quot;Be prepared.&quot;</p>
			<p>As we enter  eh Advent season once more, we are not preparing for the coming of the Christ  Child; that already happened more than 2000 years ago. Rather, in Advent we  break our normal routine and move into heightened alert to perceive more  intensely the ways in which Emmanuel, God-with-us, is moving us toward that  vision of peace and unity so eloquently described by Isaiah in the first  reading. The prophet dreams of how all people stream toward the city of peace,  all dwell in unity, swords are beaten into ploughshares, spears into pruning  hooks, and there's no more training for war.</p>
			<p>Paul offers  concrete advice about how we might do this intense preparation for the coming  fullness of the peaceable kingdom. He exhorts Christians to &quot;throw off works of  darkness and put on the armour of light.&quot; He recognises that the peace of which  Isaiah dreamed, and which the coming of Christ brought about in a new way, does  not come without a struggle. It takes more than mere wishing and longing to  make it a reality. Paul imagines us going onto battle, metaphorically speaking.</p>
			<p>To prepare  for the struggle, Paul would have us polish up our body armour of virtues. He  speaks of the kind of training one must undergo to be able to be the bearers of  light. He warns against excesses and indulgences that make one sated and  sluggish. Instead, traditional practices of prayer and fasting can carve out an  inner space to tend the light we are asked to bear. Paul also warns against  rivalry and jealousy. By putting on Christ we don the armaments of forgiveness  and community building.</p>
			<p>We are urged  in the Scriptures of this first Sunday of Advent to go beyond defensive  preparations, Readying ourselves for the full expression of the peaceable  kingdom also entails initiating nonviolent action to dismantle weapons of war  and transform whatever there may be in our heart that is not yet able to wage  peace. Swords are not beaten into ploughshares without intentional acts to  dismantle the stockpile of weapons. The Second Vatican Council's &quot;Pastoral  Constitution on the Church on the Modern Word&quot; also reminds us&gt; &quot;While  extravagant sums are being spent for the furnishing of ever new weapons, an  adequate remedy cannot be provided for the multiple miseries afflicting the  whole modern world&quot; (#81)</p>
			<p>Today's  Gospel impresses upon us the urgency of engaging in the struggles for peace.  The mages of the unprepared ones whose homes are broken into or who are left  behind are not meant to frighten us, but serve as reminders that there will e  an time when all our preparations, all our attempts to be alert and all our  efforts to disarm our hearts and wage peace will, in a critical moment, reach  fruition. And we will be ready.</p>
