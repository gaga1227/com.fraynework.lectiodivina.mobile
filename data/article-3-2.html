			<p><b>35</b> The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad, the desert shall rejoice and blossom; like the crocus<sup>2</sup>it shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of the LORD, the majesty of our God.<sup>3</sup>Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees.<sup>4</sup>Say to those who are of a fearful heart, "Be strong, do not fear! Here is your God. He will come with vengeance, with terrible recompense. He will come and save you."</p>
			<p><sup>5</sup>Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped;<sup>6</sup>then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the speechless sing for joy. For waters shall break forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert.<sup>10</sup>And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with singing; everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
