			<p><sup>10</sup>Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, saying,<sup>11</sup>Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.<sup>12</sup>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test.<sup>13</sup>Then Isaiah said: "Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary mortals, that you weary my God also?<sup>14</sup>Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look, the young woman is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel."</p>
