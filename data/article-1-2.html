			<h1 class="deco">Isaiah 2:1-5 <span class="debugInfo">[1,2]</span></h1>
			<p><sup>2</sup>The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.<sup>2</sup>In days to come the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills; all the nations shall stream to it.3Many peoples shall come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths." For out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.4He shall judge between the nations, and shall arbitrate for many peoples; they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.5O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the LORD!</p>
