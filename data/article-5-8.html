			<p><b>2</b> In the time of King Herod, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,<sup>2</sup>asking, "Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage."<sup>3</sup>When King Herod heard this, he was frightened, and all Jerusalem with him;<sup>4</sup>and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born.<sup>5</sup>They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it has been written by the prophet:<sup>6</sup>'And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people Israel.'"<sup>7</sup>Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared.<sup>8</sup>Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage."</p>
			<p><sup>9</sup>When they had heard the king, they set out; and there, ahead of them, went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child was.<sup>10</sup>When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy.<sup>11</sup>On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.<sup>12</sup>And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by another road. </p>
