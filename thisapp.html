				<p>The Catholic Diocese of Broken Bay has been creating <i>lectio divina</i> guides for the Seasons of Lent and Advent since 2009. During the past 4 years, these guides have reached over 70,000 people across every diocese in Australia and beyond.</p>
				<p>More information about the reflective prayer of <i>lectio divina</i> can be found on the Diocesan website <a href="http://www.dbb.org.au" data-link="external">www.dbb.org.au</a>. An electronic booklet and reflection pages are also available for download.</p>
				<h2>The Star of Bethlehem</h2>
				<p>The images throughout this App are commonly known in Australia as the Star of Bethlehem, Lily of the Nile, African Lilies, or Agapanthus. These beautiful globes of predominantly purple flowers are a well-recognised reminder that we are approaching the Christmas Season. The soft purple, with a hint of blue, reflect the Church's seasonal colour for Advent, with their gradual awakening from deep-green seed pod to glorious display of blossom â€“ a living example of the preparation and joyous expectation of  new life we all share during Advent.</p>
