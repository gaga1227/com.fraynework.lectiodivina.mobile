				<p>The Vatican Council gave new impetus to the Catholic emphasis on the Word of God. The Scriptures emerged as an essential element in the journey with Jesus to the Father. Catholics took up the study of the bible with renewed interest. At a Synod at the Vatican in the first decade of the twenty first century, the bishops became aware that while the Catholic Church had engaged effectively in the study of the bible, it needed to do more to help believers engage with the Scriptures in their daily lives: not only to study the Scriptures, but to take them up personally in prayer; to make their own the mysteries they contain, and to enter into a deeper intimacy in this encounter with Christ. </p>
				<p>A prayerful reading of the Scriptures had been the backbone of monastic life over the centuries, and had been an important help in the spiritual journey of the monks. It focused them on the meaning of their monastic life, and helped them to grow closer to Jesus, and to transform their life in a way that was appropriate for a disciple of Jesus. It was now reaching a much broader audience, and many believers found it an important way to engage with the Scriptures, not in terms of study, but in terms of their relationship with Jesus.</p>
				<p>Believers today have taken to this traditional form of praying the Scriptures. It has not replaced our emphasis on the scientific study of the Scriptures: nor should it. However, it has opened up the Scriptures in a new way. The Scriptures have become for many not just information about the mystery of Jesus but a means of engaging with that mystery. If "ignorance of the Scriptures is ignorance of Christ" (St Jerome), then surely a greater familiarity with them leads us to a deeper intimacy with Christ.</p>
				<p>During the Advent season we are invited to take up this reflective approach to the Word of God, to see it as an opportunity to enter through a door to a new understanding, renewed memories all of which invites us into a deeper relationship with the One born in time, who lives among us, whose life we share through Baptism, whose coming in glory we await.</p>
