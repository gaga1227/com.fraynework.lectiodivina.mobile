			<p>In today's 1<sup>st</sup> reading the prophet Isaiah tells Ahaz, the king of Judah, that, "therefore the lord himself will give you a sign. Look, the young woman is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel." 600 years or so later the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and told him, "Joseph, Son of David,  do not be afraid----the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel, which means God is with us."</p>
			<p>In his letter to the Romans, Paul reminds us of the promise God made through the prophets, such as Isaiah, that God's son, Jesus, "was descended from David according to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit". When Jesus had been baptised by John in the Jordan as he emerged from the waters of the River Jordan and the waters of <i>baptismos</i> cascaded from him the heavens were torn open, the Spirit descended on him like dove and God declared this is my Son, my beloved.</p>
			<p>In a few short days we will celebrate with great joy that a young woman, Mary, who was a virgin, who was with child 2,000 years ago, bore a son, Jesus, who is Emmanuel or "God is with Us" incarnate. God has indeed sent us a sign. And what a sign God sent! God sent God's only son, Jesus, the living sign that God is with us.</p>
			<p>In a few days we will celebrate again the greatest miracle that you or I will ever experience. We will celebrate that Jesus the Christ, the Son of the living God, became flesh in completion of the promise God made in the prophets. Jesus, the Word of God, took on our humanity so that we may share in his Divinity. What an incredible gift! God fulfilled God's promise by living among us as one of us, so that we may be touched by and may touch the Divine.</p>
			<p>We all celebrate Christmas in a different way. Some of us gather on the beach with prawns and salads. Some of us gather in parks, playing cricket and reclining under the trees. Some of us gather in homes crammed with friends and relatives, wearing silly hats and reading awful jokes from Christmas bon bons. Some of us gather with others who have no-one to celebrate Christmas with and together touch the Divine by being with each other. However you may plan to celebrate the great miracle which is Christmas, please take some time to remember the young virgin who brought the Divine into our world. Please take some time to remember the promise made by God through the prophets, fulfilled in the birth of Jesus. Please take some time to remember that the reason for this season is that child, Jesus, Emmanuel, God is with us!</p>
			<p>However you celebrate Christmas may the Divine touch you and may you share that touch with the ones you love.</p>
