			<p>In the Roman Catholic calendar, Epiphany is celebrated as a single day, and the weeks between January 6 and Ash Wednesday are counted as the first part of Ordinary Time, which continues after the close of Easter season.</p>
			<p>An <i>epiphany</i> is a revelation - a sudden, often-intuitive sighting of the essence that lies behind the world's mask. For Christians, Epiphany celebrates the visit of the Magi to the infant Jesus, and the recognition that Christ came to Earth for all people.</p>
            <h3>Matthew 2 : 1 - 2; 9b - 11a</h3>
			<p><i>In the time of King Herod, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, asking, "Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage." ...</i></p>
			<p><i>They set out; and there, ahead of them, went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy. On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother...</i></p>
			<p>An epiphany comes at a turning point on the road. A place where the trip expands into something larger than it seemed at first. A moment that changes not only the route and destination, but also the pilgrim.</p>
			<p>Every Epiphany comes with its own journey. And every journey starts with the will and courage (or in some cases, the harebrained craziness) to set out on the road, and to be vulnerable to change.</p>
			<p>By the grace of God, this will, courage, craziness, and vulnerability seems to be built right into us.</p>
			<p>Each day of our lives we are called to appropriate the gift which is offered to us in him. Salvation did not drop from the sky like a blanket (or <i>deus ex machina</i>) on an unsuspecting world, covering all with its warmth and security. Salvation, rather came in the form of a <i>gift</i> which must be accepted and "unwrapped" in order to be fully appropriated. Salvation came in human form as a <i>person</i> who must be welcomed, loved, heeded and followed.</p>
			<p>Given that focus then, all subsequent gift giving and receiving should be understood as a reflection of and a response to the ultimate GIFT. In his reflection on this particular feast, Charles A. Curran has remarked that the practice of gift giving is truly redemptive. "A gift says I care about you. Because of such gifts we come to sense our own special worth to other people. We are honoured and dignified by them and we are, in a very literal way, redeemed. Receiving a gift impresses us with a deep sense of our own meaning and so helps us to see ourselves in a more noble and respectful light." (<i>The Word Becomes Flesh, A Psychodynamic Approach to Homiletics and Catechesis and Meditations</i>, Loyola University Press, Chicago: 1974).</p>
			<p>Through the gift of Jesus, celebrated once again on this feast of Epiphany as universal saviour, God had revealed to us our special worth. Because of Jesus, we are honoured, dignified, and redeemed. Today, as we appropriate anew the saving power of God in Christ, we are thereby challenged to offer similar gifts to one another, viz. gifts which honour, dignify and redeem.</p>
