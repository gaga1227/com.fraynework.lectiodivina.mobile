			<p>For us who believe and who celebrate the Word of God made flesh as the source of life and light and truth, Christmas is a renewal of our faith and of our commitment to the challenge of that word. </p>
			<p>Let us remember that because of the <i>incarnation</i>, we respond, not to a concept or an ideology or a philosophy, but to a living and loving <i>person</i>.</p>
			<ol>
                <li><i>The good news of Christ proclaimed by the Church in the pulpit must resound more loudly and more joyfully in the marketplace.</i></li>
                <li><i>No longer through a glass darkly, but in the light of Christ, we behold the fullness of the Father's love.</i></li>
                <li><i>In the word made flesh, God speaks the language of our flesh and blood, in the pulsing of our needs and aspirations and even in the shadows of our sinful darker side. </i></li>
            </ol>
